AVR Interrupts This repository provides a collection of examples and resources for working with interrupts on AVR microcontrollers. Interrupts play a vital role in embedded systems by allowing the microcontroller to respond to external events in a timely manner.  

Key Features:
Introduction to interrupts and their importance in embedded systems Examples of configuring and using different types of interrupts on AVR microcontrollers Demonstrations of interrupt-driven programming techniques for efficient event handling Clear explanations and code samples for understanding the interrupt handling process Integration with AVR development tools, such as Atmel Studio or Arduino IDE Contents Overview of interrupts and their benefits in AVR microcontrollers Introduction to interrupt vectors and their assignment in the AVR architecture Configuration and setup of external and internal interrupts Handling interrupt service routines (ISRs) and associated best practices Examples of interrupt-driven programming for specific use cases (e.g., timer interrupts, GPIO interrupts) Practical applications and case studies showcasing the effectiveness of interrupts in real-world scenarios Usage and Contributions Feel free to explore the examples, utilize the code snippets, and adapt them to your specific AVR projects. Contributions and improvements to the repository are highly welcomed. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or additional examples to share, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
